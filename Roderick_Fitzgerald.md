My name is Roderick Fitzgerald.
I joined CodeYou with the hopes of learning coding to:
1. Help my Dad update an app he created in the late 2,000's back on the app store.
2. Learn web development for the purpose of selling art online in the future.
3. Find a decent career path to make a living from while pursuing the first two, impractical, goals.
4. Continue gaining new skills.
